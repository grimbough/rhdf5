Description: This package provides an interface between HDF5 and R. 
    HDF5's main features are the ability to store and access very large and/or
    complex datasets and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage (disk) 
    through a completely portable file format. The rhdf5 package is thus suited
    for the exchange of large and/or complex datasets between R and other 
    software package, and for letting R applications work on datasets that are 
    larger than the available RAM.
