\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{H5IdComponent}}

\item{e1}{An \code{H5IdComponent} object representing an H5 file or group.}

\item{e2}{Character giving the path to an HDF5 group or dataset relative to \code{e1}.}

\item{x}{Object of class \code{H5IdComponent} representing the HDF5 dataset from
which to extract element(s) or in which to replace element(s).}

\item{name}{Character giving the path to an HDF5 group or dataset relative to \code{x}.}

\item{value}{Array-like \R object containing value to be inserted into
the HDF5 dataset.}

\item{i, j, \dots}{Indices specifying elements to extract or replace. Indices
are \code{numeric} vectors or empty (missing) or \code{NULL}.  Numeric
values are coerced to integer as by \code{\link[base]{as.integer}} (and
hence truncated towards zero).}

\item{drop}{If \code{TRUE} the result is coerced to the lowest possible dimension
(see the examples).  This only works for extracting elements, not for the
replacement.  See \code{\link[base]{drop}} for further details.}

\description{
A class representing a HDF5 identifier handle. HDF5 identifiers represent
open files, groups, datasets, dataspaces, attributes, and datatypes.

\section{Methods (by generic)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{show}: Print details of the object to screen.

\item \code{&}: Returns a group handle or dataset handle for the
group or dataset \code{name} in the HDF5 location \code{h5loc}. \code{h5loc} can either be a file handle
as returned by \link{H5Fopen} or a group handle as e.g. returned by \code{h5f$g1} or
\code{h5f$'/g1/g2'}.

\item \code{$}: Reads the HDF5 object \code{name} in the HDF5 location \code{x}. \code{x} can either be
a file handle as returned by \link{H5Fopen} or a group handle as e.g. returned by
\code{h5f$g1} or \code{h5f$'/g1/g2'}.

\item \code{$<-}: Writes the assigned object to to the HDF5 file at
location e1. e1 can either be a file handle as returned by \link{H5Fopen} or a
group handle as e.g. returned by h5f$g1 or h5f$'/g1/g2's. The storage.mode
of the assigned object has to be compatible to the datatype of the HDF5
dataset. The dimension of the assigned object have to be identical the
dimensions of the HDF5 dataset. To create a new HDF5 dataset with specific
properties (e.g. compression level or chunk size), please use the function
\link{h5createDataset} first.

\item \code{[}: Subsetting of an HDF5 dataset. The function reads a
subset of an HDF5 dataset. The given dimensions have to fit the dimensions
of the HDF5 dataset.

\item \code{[<-}: Subsetting of an HDF5 dataset. The function writes
an R data object to a subset of an HDF5 dataset. The given dimensions have
to fit the dimensions of the HDF5 dataset. The HDF5 dataset has to be
created beforehand, e.g. by \link{h5createDataset}.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{ID}}{\code{integer} of length 1. Contains the handle of C-type \code{hid_t}.}

\item{\code{native}}{An object of class \code{logical}. If TRUE, array-like objects
are treated as stored in HDF5 row-major rather than R column-major
orientation. Using \code{native = TRUE} increases HDF5 file portability
between programming languages. A file written with \code{native = TRUE}
should also be read with \code{native = TRUE}}
