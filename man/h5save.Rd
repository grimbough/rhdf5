\title{Saves a one or more objects to an HDF5 file.}
\usage{
h5save(..., file, name = NULL, createnewfile = TRUE, native = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{The objects to be saved.}

\item{file}{The filename (character) of the file in which the dataset will
be located. It is also possible to provide an object of
class \linkS4class{H5IdComponent} representing a H5 location identifier
(file or group). See \code{\link[=H5Fcreate]{H5Fcreate()}}, \code{\link[=H5Fopen]{H5Fopen()}},
\code{\link[=H5Gcreate]{H5Gcreate()}}, \code{\link[=H5Gopen]{H5Gopen()}} to create an object of this
kind.}

\item{name}{A character vector of names for the datasets. The length of the
name vector should match the number of objects.}

\item{createnewfile}{If \code{TRUE}, a new file will be created if necessary.}

\item{native}{An object of class \code{logical}. If TRUE, array-like objects
are treated as stored in HDF5 row-major rather than R column-major
orientation. Using \code{native = TRUE} increases HDF5 file portability
between programming languages. A file written with \code{native = TRUE}
should also be read with \code{native = TRUE}}
}
\value{
Nothing returned.

\description{
Saves a number of R objects to an HDF5 file.
}
\details{
The objects will be saved to the HDF5 file. If the file does not exists it
will be created. The data can be read again by either \code{\link[=h5dump]{h5dump()}}
or individually for each dataset by \code{\link[=h5read]{h5read()}}.
}
\examples{

A = 1:7;  B = 1:18; D = seq(0,1,by=0.1)
h5save(A, B, D, file="ex_save.h5")
h5dump("ex_save.h5")
