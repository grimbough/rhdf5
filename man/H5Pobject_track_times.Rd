\title{Set whether to record timestamps for operations performed on an HDF5 object.}
\usage{
H5Pset_obj_track_times(h5plist, track_times = TRUE)

H5Pget_obj_track_times(h5plist)
}
\arguments{
\item{h5plist}{An \linkS4class{H5IdComponent} object representing an object
creation property list.}

\item{`logical`}{specifying whether times associated with an object should recorded.}
}
\description{
Set whether to record timestamps for operations performed on an HDF5 object.
}
\details{
Objects created using high-level
\strong{rhdf5} functions like \code{\link[=h5createDataset]{h5createDataset()}} will have this setting turned off.
This was done to ensure otherwise identical files returned the same md5 hash.
This differs from the default setting in HDF5, which is for objects to record
the times operations were performed on them.
