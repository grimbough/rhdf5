\title{Read from an HDF5 dataset}
\usage{
H5Dread(
  h5dataset,
  h5spaceFile = NULL,
  h5spaceMem = NULL,
  buf = NULL,
  compoundAsDataFrame = TRUE,
  bit64conversion,
  drop = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{h5dataset}{Object of class \link{H5IdComponent} representing an open HDF5
dataset.}

\item{h5spaceFile}{An object of class \code{H5IdComponent} representing a HDF5
dataspace. See \code{\link[=H5Dget_space]{H5Dget_space()}}, \code{\link[=H5Screate_simple]{H5Screate_simple()}}, \code{\link[=H5Screate]{H5Screate()}} to
create an object of this kind.}

\item{h5spaceMem}{An object of class \code{H5IdComponent} representing a HDF5
dataspace. See \code{\link[=H5Dget_space]{H5Dget_space()}}, \code{\link[=H5Screate_simple]{H5Screate_simple()}}, \code{\link[=H5Screate]{H5Screate()}} to
create an object of this kind. The dimensions of the dataset in the file and
in memory. The dimensions in file and in memory are interpreted in an R-like
manner. The first dimension is the fastest changing dimension. When reading
the file with a C-program (e.g. HDFView) the order of dimensions will invert,
because in C the fastest changing dimension is the last one.}

\item{buf}{Buffer to hold the read data.  The buffer size has to fit the
size of the memory space \code{h5spaceMem}. No extra memory will be allocated for
the data. A pointer to the same data is returned.}

\item{compoundAsDataFrame}{Logical vector of length 1. If \code{TRUE}, a compound
datatype will be coerced to a \code{data.frame}. This is not possible, if the
dataset is multi-dimensional. Otherwise the compound datatype will be
returned as a \code{list}. Nested compound data types will be returned as a
nested \code{list}.}

\item{bit64conversion}{Defines how 64-bit integers are converted. (See
the details section for more information on these options.)}

\item{drop}{Logical vector of length 1.  If \code{TRUE}, the HDF5 object is read
as a vector with NULL dim attributes. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
\code{H5Dread()} reads a (partial) dataset from an HDF5 file into the R session.
}
\details{
Internally, R does not support 64-bit integers. All integers in R are 32-bit
integers. By setting bit64conversion='int', a coercing to 32-bit integers is
enforced, with the risk of data loss, but with the insurance that numbers
are represented as integers. bit64conversion='double' coerces the 64-bit
integers to floating point numbers. doubles can represent integers with up
to 54-bits, but they are not represented as integer values anymore. For
larger numbers there is again a data loss. bit64conversion='bit64' is
recommended way of coercing. It represents the 64-bit integers as objects
of class 'integer64' as defined in the package 'bit64'. Make sure that you
have installed 'bit64'. The datatype 'integer64' is not part of base R, but
defined in an external package. This can produce unexpected behaviour when
working with the data.
