\title{Combine two selections}
\usage{
H5Scombine_select(h5space1, op, h5space2)
}
\arguments{
\item{h5space2}{}
}
\value{
Returns an \linkS4class{H5IdComponent} object representing a new dataspace.
The new dataspace will have the same extent as \code{h5space1} with the
hyperslab selection being the result of combining the selections of
\code{h5space1} and \code{h5space2}.
}

Combine two selections

\examples{

## create two 1 dimensional dataspaces
## of different sizes
sid_1 <- H5Screate_simple(dims = 20)
sid_2 <- H5Screate_simple(dims = 10)

## select a single block of 5 points in sid_1
## this is equivalent to [11:16] in R syntax
H5Sselect_hyperslab(sid_1, start = 11, stride = 1, 
                    block = 5, count = 1)

## select 2 blocks of 1 point from sid_2
## equivalent to [c(3,5)] in R syntax
H5Sselect_hyperslab(sid_2, start = 3, stride = 2, 
                    block = 1, count = 2)

## confirm we have select 5 and 2 points resepectively
H5Sget_select_npoints(sid_1)
H5Sget_select_npoints(sid_2)

## combine the two dataset selections keeping points that
## are in one or both of the selections
sid_3 <- H5Scombine_select(sid_1, "H5S_SELECT_OR", sid_2)

## extent of the new dataset is the same as sid_1
sid_3
## confirm the selection contains 7 points
H5Sget_select_npoints(sid_3)

## tidy up
H5Sclose(sid_1)
H5Sclose(sid_2)
H5Sclose(sid_3)
